in this project, I am going to use the dataset "Electronic Products and Pricing Data" from data.world.

in overview, this dataset is recorded the pricing information about 7,000 electronics, such as brand, category, merchant. the description mentioned the dataset has the potential to develop model related to pricing strategy.

about the data mining procedure, i planned to implement my project in accordance with cross idustry standard process for data mining which included six consecutive phases:

1. Business understanding
2. data understanding
3. data preparation
4. model building
5. testing and evaluation
6. deployment

at the business understanding phases:
	the business objective, data mining goals will be determined regarding to the situation which is potentially affecting data mining project
	
at the data understanding phases:
	the collected data will be descripted, explored, and verified with data visualization tool.
	
at the data preparation phases:
	this phases will complete selection of observation and variable which are involved to decision making. meanwhile, the pahses also perform the data cleaning and variable aggregation
	
at the modeling technique:
	i will conduct the model selection to seek the optimal solution for the project problem
	#1 prediction
	#2 clustering
	#3 association rule

at the testing and evaluation:
	using different validation tool, i will evaluate different model accuracy to select the optimal model.
